Getting a little Lexical homework responses

1. I was getting similar timings when initializing and filling the arrays both ways so I am not sure if this is a error on my part or simply that they have similar run times, the differences being 1 to 2 ms


3.my values were  array static: 2464 , array stack: 2500 , array dynamic: 2507. It makes sense that the static array would be the fastest as read in the powerpoint, the advantage of static arrays are the fastest since no dynamic allocation or deallocation is required. The stack-dynamic and heap-dynamic are very similar and this is because both need allocation and deallocation, the advantage that they have is that they have greater flexibility since the size of the array can change if needed whereas the static cannot but this does not help with runtime.
